Webapp with Create React App and Spring Boot
===

Developing Spring applications with Spring Boot is a real time saver. It gets you up and running quickly, and 
continues to make your life easier as you move to production and start releasing incremental updates to your
application. 

Create React App does the same thing for your React frontend. It speeds up the initial phase by stitching together
everything you need to get your React frontend working with minimal effort on your part, and it shortens your feedback
loop by enabling hot reload. That way, you can just save your files, and changes will be immediately visible in 
the browser. 

To run the application:

1)Download the code on your local 

2)In the location of pom.xml, open Command Prompt

3)Run this command : mvn install

4)Navigate to the target folder, and run this command: java -jar bookstore-1.0.0.jar
